<p>The Chordocycle is an interactive tool for creating cyclical chord progressions. Chords in the left circle are arranged according to the "circle of thirds" (alternating major and minor triads with two common tones between every adjacent pair). Users can drag a chord from the left circle and drop it into the right circle to place it in the chord progression. Hitting the play button will play the chord progression along with a beat for reference. The educational philsophy for this centers on allowing learners to create music with larger parts (chords) and letting the rewards of this process motivate a deep dive into their components (notes). I built the live prototype in javascript and HTML using the p5.js and Tone.js libraries.</p>
