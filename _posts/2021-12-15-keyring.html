<p>The Keyring is a tool that unifies all versions of a given chord or scale into a single shape. This enables learners to form a more clear mental concept of harmonic structures, and greatly assists in showing the relationship between a given diatonic chord and its underlying scale. After a series of protypes I created in HTML, CSS, and javascript, I worked with front-end developer Sean Colsen, who created the latest version. </p>
<p>Here is an interactive embed of the tool. You can create shapes on different layers by clicking the layer and then then clicking keys within the Keyring. Layers can be rotated or locked together when the top layer is a subset of the bottom.</p>
