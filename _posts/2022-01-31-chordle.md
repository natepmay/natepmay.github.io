Chordle is a web app that develops skills in building chords using common tones, based off of the popular game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). I built it in HTML, CSS, and javascript using the Tone.js library and bundled it with webpack. 

The game was played by 10,000 people within the first four days of going online, and was adopted in music classrooms around the country. It has now been played over 160,000 times in 133 countries.
