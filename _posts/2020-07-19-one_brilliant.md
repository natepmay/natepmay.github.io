*One Brilliant* was commissioned as part of Brianna Matzke's "Response Project" series, in response to the *Sonic Meditations* of Pauline Oliveros. I wrote the piece in a scrolling video score format that I developed, which allows performers to coordinate non-metrical rhythms with ease, and synchronizes them with an electronic track. I made the electronic track from samples I took of myself playing an accordion and an air pump, both in response to Oliveros's works.

The concert was premiered online through a series of videos recorded in a historic theater in Cincinnati, Ohio. A recording project is currently underway.

The concert received attention from [*City Beat*](https://www.citybeat.com/arts/cincinnati-pianist-brianna-matzkes-latest-response-project-blends-art-music-film-and-meditation-with-local-historical-sites-12169945) and [*Cinci Magazine*](https://www.cincymagazine.com/a-musical-response/?fbclid=IwAR0XlqbKPi2C3Irs6xz36uRyUBgivTeGosK7pBXQuH3XeavDZvLk2OVUyog).
