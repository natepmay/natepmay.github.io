<p>West Virginia-based saxophonist Jeff Siegfried commissioned me to write this piece inspired by West Virginia, and pointed me to the intersection of the natural and the unreal. The result is an explosive and difficult piece that pushes the boundaries of the instrument while exploring these themes. Here are the program notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there’s intelligent life on a nearby planet, the first people to know about it will be the folks at the Green Bank telescope, who are sitting around in Pocahontas County, West Virginia, listening to the radio. The radio is technically just a longer version of the same waves we call light, and stars send out lots of different lengths of waves, which are picked up by different telescopes. The one at Green Bank is a radio telescope, so it picks up the long waves.
</p>
<p>Stars look white, and the idea of white light is a broad band of lengths—say from a millimeter to a nanometer with everything in between covered. But what looks white to us is often not a continuous band—it’s got notches at particular lengths, and the arrangements of notches tell us about the chemical makeup of whatever’s shining. 
</p>
<p>You can hear this idea in the middle of the piece, where I do this with lengths of sound waves and it ends up sounding like breathing. Each breath is the same notch arrangement as hydrogen, lithium, carbon, helium, or oxygen. Instead of white light, it’s notched out of something close to white noise: the sounds of rushing air and water, which I recorded not far from the Green Bank telescope. White sounds, like white light, can be thought of as a broad band of sound waves of infinite different lengths. I hope it’s not too far-fetched to point here why these notches might sound like breath: when we breathe we’re taking the white sound of rushing air and filtering it through material with its own sonic fingerprint—our flesh. 
</p>
<p>The idea of these little fingerprints—these notch arrangements—also inspired all of the harmonic material played by the saxophone in the piece. There are only three of them.
</p>
<p>The way the first movement unfolds in rhythm and contour is a whole different story—it’s a slowed down algorithm of when you slide your finger across a cello string and listen to the harmonics. But the harmonic series has been replaced by these three notch arrangements.
</p>
<p>On November 15, 1988, the previous radio telescope at Green Bank collapsed suddenly and completely. This was a 300-foot-tall structure that one moment was sitting there quietly listening for aliens, and in the next it was a buckled-up pile of steel beams.
</p>
<p>Can you imagine the sound that made?</p>
