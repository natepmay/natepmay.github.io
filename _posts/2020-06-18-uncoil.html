<p>Uncoil is engraving software I created in Python to take a standard MIDI file and convert it into a scrolling score with five-line staves. Players play notes when they intersect a vertical line on the left side of the screen. Duration is indicated by the length of a line that follows each note, and dynamics are indicated by the color of the line. Pedal markings can also be added automatically from the MIDI file. The resulting file can be used in the Decibel Score Player, which allows synchronous playing of scrolling scores by multiple members in an ensemble.</p>
<p>I used this system in <a href="{% post_url 2020-07-19-one_brilliant %}"><em>One Brilliant</em></a> and <a href="{% post_url 2021-03-16-liquid_animal %}"><em>Liquid Animal</em></a>.</p>
<p>Here's is an example from <em>One Brilliant</em>. In this case, a MIDI realization of the performance is heard along with a synchronized tape track.</p>
