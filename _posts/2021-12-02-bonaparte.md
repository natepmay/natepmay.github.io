*Bonaparte Crossing the Rhine* is a split album with experimental/old-time musician Ben Townsend. In response to Townsend's Terry Riley-inspired treatment of the fiddle tune "Bonaparte Corssing the Rhine", I contributed a 20-minute electronic composition by the same name, which plays with the material of the tune, the recording of the tune itself, and a sculpted soundscape of white-ish noise.

The album was released on Questionable Records.
