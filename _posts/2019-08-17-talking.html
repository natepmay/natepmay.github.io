<p>This piece was commissioned by the Norfolk Choral Festival, where I was the composer-in-residence in 2019. The piece explores tonelessness in verbal communication, creating textures that involve the interaction of sibilance from the choir and toneless techniques from the ensemble. It is framed in a nonsense drama led by the soloist. The text for the piece comes from entirely from public tweets. I wrote software that arranged the tweets by their phonemes and assigned them in 32-part divisi, allowing the brou-ha-ha of simultaneous speech to converge timbrally.</p>
