<p>The Soundspitter is a digital instrument I created in Python and Supercollider. Through a series of prompts, it creates loops of short sounds that are arranged according to timbral parameters set by the user. These parameters can be anything, and they are "taught" to the computer through the use of machine learning. The result could be, for instance, a series of sound samples arranged according to their "anthropomorphism" in a repeating "up-down" pattern. This was designed for use by an electronic music ensemble, allowing multiple players to contribute to a larger texture from different points in space. It was used by the Montclair State Electronic Music Ensemble in the performance of my piece <em>\xfb$</em> at the George Segal Art Gallery in 2019.</p>
