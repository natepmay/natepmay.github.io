*Liquid Animal* came out of a need for music that could be performed remotely during Covid, and was designed to be as flexible as possible to allow for multiple instrumental combinations, performance formats, player levels, and even performance speeds. 

In addition to the premiere at Purchase College, a performance by the Rhodes College Orchestra was scheduled in 2021 but was canceled.

I composed the piece using the scrolling score format I developed. The full score can be seen in the video below.
