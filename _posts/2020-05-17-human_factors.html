<p><em>Music Theory: Human Factors</em> is an online publication I started focusing on the human elements of music theory, drawing on the work of Robert Gjerdingen, Kofi Agawu, and Arnie Cox. It features writings by graduate students in my music theory seminar at Montclair State, as well as myself.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from the introductory article I wrote, "What Are the Human Factors in Music Theory?"</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Among music theorists, music has also often been understood to be an autonomous system. The Pythagoreans, known for their contributions to mathematics, were also music theorists who developed influential systems for tuning intervals based on mathematical principles. The Roman philosopher Boethius understood music to be a system that governed heavenly bodies and human bodies, all through mathematical means. In the 19th century, a dominant strain of musical thought took to the notion of an “absolute” music, which could be said to generate, follow, and even teach its own logic. The emerging field of music theory as distinct from musicology in 20th-century America was largely predicated on a dedication to analyses that took this autonomy as fact, and analysis became about uncovering hidden structures in notes that were taken as proof of the work’s greatness and the composer’s privileged access to these systems. Some composers in the 20th century also became enchanted with the creation of autonomous musical systems that extended logically from various musical premises. But all the while, many listeners were maintaining a direct relationship with the phenomenon of music — the experience that needs no explanation, yet often holds deeply personal truths.</p>
    <p>Is it possible, then, for me to write about music in a way that is meaningful to someone besides myself, without relying on “objective” determinations of greatness? Is there room for human factors in music theory, a discipline whose proclaimed focus is the content of music itself, rather than context of its creation?</p>
