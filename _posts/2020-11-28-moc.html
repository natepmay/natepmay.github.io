<p>The Midnight Oil Collective is a creator-led venture studio that is creating a new model for arts funding in the United States. I am one of nine co-founders and currently serve on the board. In addition to helping steer the group, I have contributed in the areas of graphic design, marketing, video editing, cybersecurity, social media, web, management, and other areas.</p>
<p>Midnight Oil Collective has been supported by the Tsai Center for Innovative Thinking at Yale, COLLAB New Haven, and the Innovation and Innovation Clinic at Yale Law.</p>
<p>We run an incubator and accelerator, and some of the projects we have helped include TV shows, operas, theatrical projects, a record label, a film, and a publishing group.</p>
