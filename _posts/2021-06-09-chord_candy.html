<p>This course grew out of my own values for music educationâ€”making it accessible to people outside of notated traditions, grounding it in examples from diverse repertoire, and drawing on technology and community to enhance learning. Students are currently working their way through the self-paced course with my personal guidance when needed.</p>
<p>Part of building this course was creating a visualization system to clarify the motion of chords and scales in songs for learners with our without notation experience. This required weeks of design work, generously guided by UX designer Richard Yang, as well as extensive coding in Python and After Effects. I also managed a team of four assistants who helped encode each song's melodic and harmonic motion in the system I designed.</p>
