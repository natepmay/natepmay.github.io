[sheet2coll] is an object for Max/MSP that makes external spreadsheets (e.g. info about musical timing, cues, etc.) usable within the program. I used it for my <a href="{% post_url 2021-12-31-tync %}">Tync</a> patch, which I used for my piece <a href="{% post_url 2021-10-28-21cm %}"><em>21cm</em></a>. It is currently published as an open source project on Github.
